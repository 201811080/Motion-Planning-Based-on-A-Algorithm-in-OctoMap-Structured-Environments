#Motion Planning Based on A* Algorithm in OctoMap
Structured Environments

The graduation thesis "Motion Planning Based on A* Algorithm in OctoMap
Structured Environments" deals with the processing and presentation of the results
obtained by applying the A* algorithm for finding shortest paths on a matrix structured
environment as well as quadtree structured environments with the extension
to quadtrees with discretized node boundaries. In this paper, the implementation
details of these data structures are discussed, with the extension to octrees as a
data structure for 3D space modelling. The paper compares Dijkstra’s algorithm
and the popular A* algorithm and analyses the details of the implementation and
adaptation of the A* algorithm to work with these data structures with the open
possibility to modify the algorithm’s working parameters. Finally, the paper discusses
the efficiency of modelling a 2D environment by using quadtrees as well as the
speed and distance of the resulting paths obtained on two maps through a series of
tests with different starting parameters.
